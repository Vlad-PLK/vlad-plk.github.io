# Essential Shell Commands

**Focus Area**: Command Line Fluency

---

## üéØ Context & Objective

Getting really comfortable with the shell commands I'll use constantly in DevOps work. Building a reference guide I can come back to whenever I need it.

## ‚úÖ Work Recap & Achievements

**Command Documentation**: Put together a guide covering 60 important bash commands with examples focused on DevOps scenarios.

**Practice Time**: Actually spent time using these commands instead of just reading about them. Working on building muscle memory for the ones I'll need most.

**Real-World Context**: Connected each command to actual DevOps tasks‚Äîlog analysis, process monitoring, file manipulation, system checks.

**What I made:**
- [60 Greatest Bash Commands](https://github.com/Vlad-PLK/DevOps-Cloud-Portfolio/blob/main/docs/linux-terminal-commands.md) - my reference guide
- Practice notes with useful command combinations
- Better typing speed for common commands

## üßó Challenges & Struggles

**Too Much Info**: With so many flags and options, it's easy to try learning everything at once. Had to focus on what's actually useful first.

**Different Distros**: Some commands work differently depending on the Linux distribution. Had to look up compatibility issues.

## üìö Key Learnings & Progress

**What I learned:**
- Text processing with `sed`, `awk`, and `grep` for analyzing logs
- Process management using `ps`, `top`, `htop`, and `kill`
- File system navigation with `find`, `locate`, and `ls`
- Network troubleshooting with `netstat`, `ss`, and `lsof`

**Key Takeaway**: Time spent getting fast with the command line now saves a lot of headache later when managing multiple servers and containers.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps & Closing Thoughts

This was good, focused practice. Command-line speed matters more than people think‚Äîit's one of those things that shows experience.

Writing the documentation helped me learn. Explaining what each command does made it stick better.

Next: setting up my Mac with all the DevOps tools‚ÄîDocker, Kubernetes, cloud CLIs, etc. Better to get everything configured now than deal with installation issues while trying to learn. üõ†Ô∏è
