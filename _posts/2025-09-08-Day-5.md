# Day 5: Rebuilding Born2BeRoot‚ÄîUpgrading My Linux Server Skills

**Week 1 Focus**: Linux Fundamentals & Networking Basics

---

## üéØ Today's Objective

Transform a fresh Debian VM into a secure, production-ready server environment. This isn't just a repeat of the 42 School project - it's an upgraded version that incorporates real-world DevOps practices and security hardening.

## ‚úÖ What I Accomplished

**Production-Grade VM Setup**: Created a clean Debian installation on VirtualBox with proper resource allocation and network configuration optimized for server workloads.

**Security Hardening Implementation**: Applied comprehensive security measures including firewall configuration, SSH hardening, and system monitoring setup.

**Web Service Deployment**: Successfully deployed a complete WordPress stack using lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP - demonstrating full-stack server administration capabilities.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Hardened Debian server with UFW firewall and secure SSH configuration
- Fully functional WordPress website with optimized LAMP stack alternative
- System monitoring tools configured for performance and security tracking
- Documented server setup process with security best practices

## üßó Challenges & Struggles

**Service Integration Complexity**: Getting lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP to work together smoothly required careful configuration and troubleshooting. Each service had specific requirements that needed to be coordinated.

**Security vs. Usability Balance**: Finding the right balance between tight security and functional accessibility. Some security measures initially broke functionality, requiring iterative adjustment.

**Performance Optimization**: The VM environment required careful resource management to ensure responsive performance while running multiple services simultaneously.

## üìö Key Learnings & Progress

**Technical Skills Gained:**
- Advanced Debian system administration and package management
- Web server security hardening with UFW firewall rules and SSH key authentication
- LAMP stack deployment and optimization (lighttpd variant)
- System service management with systemd for reliable service orchestration

**DevOps Mindset Development**: Started thinking like a systems administrator who needs to balance security, performance, and maintainability - crucial skills for infrastructure management.

## üîÑ Daily Reflection

This felt like a significant step up from basic command-line work. Managing multiple interacting services and ensuring they're secure and performant requires a different level of thinking. 

The WordPress deployment was particularly satisfying - seeing a complete application stack come together on infrastructure I built and hardened myself.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Tomorrow's Plan

Deep dive into networking fundamentals and system internals. I want to strengthen my understanding of how data flows through networks, how Linux manages system resources, and how to troubleshoot complex system issues.

Time to master the foundational knowledge that makes advanced DevOps work possible! üõ°Ô∏è
