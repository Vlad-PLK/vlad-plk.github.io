# Setting Up My Mac

**Focus Area**: Development Tools

---

## üéØ Context & Objective

Getting my Mac ready with all the tools I'll need for DevOps work. Making sure everything's installed, configured, and actually working before I dive into the heavy stuff.

## ‚úÖ Work Recap & Achievements

**Dev Environment Ready**: Installed and configured the core tools for containers, orchestration, cloud work, and automation.

**Testing Everything**: Didn't just install stuff‚Äîactually tested each tool to make sure it works and plays nice with the others.

**Performance Tweaks**: Adjusted settings for better performance and smoother workflow.

**What I set up:**
- **Homebrew** - package manager for macOS
- **Docker Desktop** - for containers
- **Kubernetes (kubectl + local clusters)** - for orchestration practice
- **VirtualBox** - for running VMs
- **Dev Tools** - Python, Node.js, Git, VS Code with extensions
- **Cloud CLIs** - AWS, Azure, and GCP tools

## üßó Challenges & Struggles

**Version Conflicts**: Ran into some issues with different tool versions, especially Python dependencies. Had to figure out how to manage multiple versions cleanly.

**Resource Competition**: Docker Desktop and VirtualBox both want system resources. Had to tweak memory and CPU settings to keep both running smoothly.

**Config Quirks**: Each tool has its own setup requirements. VS Code extensions, Docker networking, Kubernetes contexts‚Äîlots of small details to get right.

## üìö Key Learnings & Progress

**What I learned:**
- macOS package management with Homebrew
- Docker Desktop setup and resource tuning
- Local Kubernetes for testing apps
- Managing multiple tools without conflicts

**Understanding the Pipeline**: Started seeing how these tools connect‚Äîfrom writing code locally, to containerizing it, to running it in Kubernetes.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps & Closing Thoughts

Not the most exciting work, but necessary. Having everything set up properly means I can focus on learning instead of fighting with installation problems.

Testing was important‚Äîbetter to find issues now than in the middle of a project.

Next: hands-on Linux server work. Setting up a Debian VM and rebuilding the "Born2BeRoot" project with a DevOps spin. üèóÔ∏è
