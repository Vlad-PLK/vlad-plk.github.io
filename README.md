# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My DevOps & Cloud Blog!

## About Me

Hi everyone! (Bonjour Ã  toutes et Ã  tous ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ¥–)

I'm **Vladimir Polojienko** (aka **Vlad-PLK** on GitHub), a 22-year-old developer currently learning System Administration, DevOps technologies, and Cloud Computing.

Although my name sounds Eastern European ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º, I'm actually a proud French-Russian living on the beautiful CÃ´te d'Azur (not a millionaire yet! ðŸ˜…).

I studied computer science at the amazing **42 Nice School**. If you're here, you're probably interested in my journey to becoming a DevOps Engineer.

## Why This Blog?

I've created this blog to document my daily progress and share my work as I challenge myself to master Linux, system administration, Docker, Kubernetes, and much more ðŸš€.

## Stay Connected

I love my life and my learning journey! Feel free to follow along, reach out, or connect with me for feedback and collaboration.
