# üèóÔ∏è Day 5: Rebuilding Born2BeRoot‚ÄîUpgrading My Linux Server Skills

Today, I took a big step forward in my DevOps journey by creating a brand new Debian virtual machine on VirtualBox. This wasn‚Äôt just any VM setup‚Äîit‚Äôs a full remake and upgrade of the classic "Born2BeRoot" project from my 42 days. The goal? Transform a fresh Linux VM into a robust, secure, and fully monitored server environment.

## Project Goals & Motivation

Having become pretty comfortable with Linux after finishing the 42 core curriculum, I wanted to push myself further. This time, I‚Äôm not just repeating the basics‚ÄîI‚Äôm aiming to master every aspect, from initial setup to advanced server configuration, and tackle all the bonus challenges.

## What I Set Up Today
- **Debian VM on VirtualBox**: Clean install, updated, and ready for action.
- **System Hardening**: Configured UFW firewall, SSH access, and essential security settings.
- **Monitoring**: Set up basic monitoring tools to keep an eye on system health and performance.

## The Bonus Challenge
For the bonus part of the project, I‚Äôm going all in:
- **WordPress Website**: Deployed a fully functional WordPress site using lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP
- **Custom Service**: I‚Äôll also set up an additional service of my choice that I find useful for a real-world server (excluding NGINX/Apache2, of course).

## Reflection

Revisiting and upgrading this project is a great way to consolidate my Linux knowledge and take my server administration skills to the next level. I‚Äôm excited to document every step, share the challenges I face, and show how much progress is possible with focused effort and a willingness to go beyond the basics.

Stay tuned for more updates as I dive deeper into server setup, automation, and real-world DevOps scenarios!
