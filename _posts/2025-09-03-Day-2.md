# üõ†Ô∏è Day 2: Building the Foundation & Launching My Blog

Today, I officially kicked off Week 1 of my DevOps roadmap: **Linux Fundamentals & Networking Basics**. As expected, Linux is at the heart of everything in the cloud and DevOps world. Even though I‚Äôm already comfortable with Linux thanks to my 42 background, I dedicated time to reviewing core concepts and sharpening my skills.

One of my main achievements today was setting up this GitHub blog! I wanted a place to document my daily progress, share resources, and showcase my journey. Creating the blog itself was a great exercise in using Git, GitHub, and Jekyll.

I also spent a good amount of time revisiting essential topics like networking, SSH, and advanced Git workflows. These are the building blocks for any DevOps engineer, and it felt great to reinforce my understanding.
