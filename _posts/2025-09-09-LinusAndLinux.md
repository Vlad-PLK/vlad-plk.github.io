# Linux System & Network Fundamentals

**Focus Area**: Networking & Security

---

## üéØ Context & Objective

Learning how the underlying systems work‚Äînetwork protocols, security, and system architecture. Understanding how Linux handles resources and how network communication actually happens.

## ‚úÖ Work Recap & Achievements

**Network Protocols**: Got a handle on TCP/IP, packet flow, and troubleshooting tools for debugging distributed systems.

**Security Hardening**: Implemented disk encryption, advanced SSH config, and access controls.

**System Architecture**: Explored Linux directory structure and resource management with a focus on operations and troubleshooting.

**What I worked on:**
- Network troubleshooting with `ping`, `netstat`, `traceroute`, `ss`
- SSH hardening with key-based auth
- Disk encryption using `cryptsetup`
- Linux filesystem documentation
- User and permission management

## üßó Challenges & Struggles

**Network Troubleshooting**: Understanding how packets actually move through the network stack took some work. Had to connect theory with practical tool usage.

**Encryption Setup**: Getting disk encryption working while keeping performance decent required some research and testing. Key management was tricky.

**Permissions**: Linux permissions look simple until you deal with groups, special permissions, and service accounts. Lots of trial and error.

## üìö Key Learnings & Progress

**What I learned:**
- TCP/IP protocol basics and packet analysis
- SSH security configuration
- Disk encryption and partition management
- Linux filesystem hierarchy
- User management and access controls

**Systems Thinking**: Started seeing how networking, storage, security, and user management all connect to build reliable infrastructure.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps & Closing Thoughts

This kind of deep foundational work helps when debugging complex issues. Understanding how things work under the hood makes troubleshooting much easier.

Hands-on practice with real tools made the abstract concepts click. I'm more confident with network troubleshooting and security now.

Next: expanding beyond VMs. Repurposing my old 2015 MacBook Pro as a Debian machine for my home lab. Having multiple machines will let me practice distributed systems scenarios. üß™
