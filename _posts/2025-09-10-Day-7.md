# Building a Simple DevOps Lab

**Focus Area**: Home Lab Setup

---

## 🎯 Context & Objective

Repurposing my old MacBook Pro as a Linux machine for DevOps practice. Adding another box to my lab so I can test multi-machine scenarios.

## ✅ Work Recap & Achievements

**Hardware Refresh**: Wiped macOS and installed Debian on my 2015 MacBook Pro. Giving old hardware a second life.

**System Config**: Set up the system for DevOps work—performance tuning, installed packages, basic optimizations.

**Multi-Machine Lab**: Now I have my main MacBook for development, a Debian VM for testing, and this machine for infrastructure experiments.

**What I set up:**
- Debian on old MacBook Pro
- Encrypted disk partitions
- Lightweight GUI for when I need it
- Network config for multi-machine communication

## 🧗 Challenges & Struggles

**Driver Issues**: Some hardware needed specific drivers. WiFi and graphics required manual setup.

**Performance Tweaking**: Balancing features with performance on older hardware. Had to pick which services to run carefully.

**Going All-In**: Completely replacing macOS meant making sure I had backups and committing to Linux-only.

## 📚 Key Learnings & Progress

**What I learned:**
- Linux installation on specific hardware
- Performance tuning for older machines
- Multi-machine network setup
- Resource management strategies

**Strategic Thinking**: Started thinking about how different machines can play different roles in a learning environment.

## ⏭️ Next Steps & Closing Thoughts

Fun project. There's something nice about giving old tech a new purpose instead of just buying new stuff.

With Linux basics covered and a multi-machine lab ready, I'm set to start with Docker and containers. Having multiple machines will be useful for testing distributed scenarios.

Ready to learn how containers change the deployment game! 🐳
