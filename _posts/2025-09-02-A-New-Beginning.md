# Let's Get This Journey Started! 👋

**Focus Area**: Getting Started

Hey there! 👋

This is where I'll be sharing what I'm learning, building, and figuring out on my path to becoming a DevOps engineer. Here's how I'll organize things.

## 📋 Blog Structure

Here's the format I'll use for my posts:

**🎯 Context & Objective** - What I'm working on and why  
**✅ Work Recap & Achievements** - What I built or learned  
**🧗 Challenges & Struggles** - Problems I ran into  
**📚 Key Learnings & Progress** - New concepts that clicked  
**⏭️ Next Steps & Closing Thoughts** - Where I'm headed next  

Simple enough to keep me consistent while sharing useful information.

## 🗺️ What I'm Aiming For

I'm documenting my journey through DevOps and cloud technologies. You can check out my full plan here: [My DevOps Roadmap](https://github.com/Vlad-PLK/DevOps-Cloud-Portfolio/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)

**What I want to learn:**

**🐧 Linux & Shell** - Getting comfortable with system administration  
**🐳 Docker & Containerization** - Building and deploying containerized apps  
**☸️ Kubernetes & Home Lab** - Setting up a home lab and learning orchestration  
**☁️ AWS Cloud** - Moving apps to the cloud  
**📜 Certifications** - AWS Solutions Architect Associate and CKA  

The goal? Build enough skills to start freelancing as a DevOps engineer.

## 🚀 Starting with the Basics

**Linux & Networking** - Since everything in DevOps runs on Linux, I'm revisiting the fundamentals. Even with my background from 42 School, there's always more to learn, especially around operations and automation.

**What I'm covering:**
- Command line operations and shell scripting
- Networking basics (TCP/IP, DNS, firewalls)
- SSH setup and security  
- Git workflows for infrastructure code

## 💡 Why Blog About This?

A few reasons: it keeps me on track, helps me remember what I've learned, and shows potential clients how I work. Plus, if someone else finds it useful, that's a bonus.

Every problem I solve and every "aha!" moment will be documented here.

Let's see where this goes! 🚀
