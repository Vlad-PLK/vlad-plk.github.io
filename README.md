Hi everyone! (Bonjour Ã  toutes et Ã  tous ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ¥–)

I'm **Vladimir Polojienko** (aka **Vlad-PLK** on GitHub), a 22-year-old developer with a warm and friendly spirit, always eager to connect and share my journey.

After completing the core curriculum at the renowned **42 Nice School** and validating my first internship in a blockchain startup, I found myself searching for a new challengeâ€”a fresh step in my developer journey. For a while, I wasnâ€™t sure what I wanted to become. I launched myself as a self-employed entrepreneur, exploring various business ventures and successfully building a solid, comfortable income. However, I realized I had drifted too far from my initial path: programming.

After some tough self-reflection, I decided to reinvent my career and set my sights on becoming a DevOps engineer. I gave myself 3 to 4 months to truly master all the essential skills in the market and to make DevOps my main freelance activity.

This new challenge reignited my excitement for learning and growth. The prospect of tackling so many new skills, acquiring fresh knowledge, and diving into an entirely new area of programming gave me a renewed sense of purpose. This journey is about pushing my limits, proving to myself that everything I learned at 42 and through my personal experiences has prepared me to break into a new fieldâ€”and come out stronger than ever.

If youâ€™re here, youâ€™re witnessing not just my technical progress, but also my personal transformation. I hope my story inspires you to embrace new challenges and believe in your own ability to grow, adapt, and succeed.

## Why This Blog?

This blog is much more than a simple collection of daily notesâ€”it's a cornerstone of my learning journey and a project that truly matters to me. By documenting every step, I create a powerful tool for reflection, growth, and accountability. Sharing my progress publicly motivates me to push further, while also providing a transparent record of my dedication, discipline, and the real challenges I face along the way.

Through this blog, I want to leave a genuine trace of my DevOps challenge: every difficulty, every breakthrough, every project, and every success. Itâ€™s a living transcript of my journey, capturing not only the technical skills I acquire but also the mindset, perseverance, and problem-solving required to master DevOps. It's my way of showing all my work and my real hands-on experience ! I think and I've camed accross the conclusion that today : the most important thing and the most valuable skill when applying for a tech job is the real experience you've had and what you've really build

Finally, my goal is to show that with unwavering determination and true discipline, anyone can achieve masteryâ€”even in a demanding field like DevOps. I hope my story inspires others to believe in themselves, embrace the learning process, and realize that progress is built one day at a time. This blog is also my way of proving that with the right mindset, hard work, and a willingness to share both struggles and victories, success is within reach for anyone willing to take on the challenge.
