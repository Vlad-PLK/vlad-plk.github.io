Welcome everyone to my Daily Blog! ðŸ‘‹

Okay, here we go again !
Day one of becoming a DevOps, what should i get into ?
So first of all I made a new public repository to share all my current and future work named as simple as : [DevOps Cloud Portfolio](https://github.com/Vlad-PLK/DevOps-Cloud-Portfolio)
I wanted to create straight of, a space where all of my projects, my documentation, my tools and all of the different things I work with during my learning process. I think that this is a great thing to start with because it will be a good exemple of my progression but also a sign of my determination, my discipline and real hands on project for my future interviews. 
Then I also created a complete RoadMap so I can go straight forward from one point to another with clear goals, skills and projects : [The Great RoadMap](https://github.com/Vlad-PLK/DevOps-Cloud-Portfolio/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)

Now that I have all of this setup, I think that it's time to work !

Week 1 Day 1 : getting back to linux
