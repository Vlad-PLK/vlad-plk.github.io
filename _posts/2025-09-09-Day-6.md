# üõ°Ô∏è Day 6: Deep Dive into Linux System & Network Fundamentals

Today was a highly productive day focused on strengthening my understanding of Linux internals and making my Debian VM as secure and functional as possible for my DevOps journey.

## System & Network Fundamentals

I dedicated a significant part of the day to studying and practicing:
- **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**: Explored how data moves through the network stack, reviewed packet structure, and experimented with basic network troubleshooting tools (`ping`, `netstat`, `traceroute`).
- **SSH & Security**: Hardened SSH access by configuring key-based authentication, disabling root login, and tuning security settings to minimize attack surfaces.
- **Disk Partitioning & Encryption**: Used tools like `fdisk`, `lsblk`, and `cryptsetup` to create, manage, and encrypt disk partitions‚Äîensuring both flexibility and data security for my VM.
- **Linux Directory Structure**: Reviewed the purpose and best practices for `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, `/home`, `/opt`, and other key directories to better understand system organization and where to place files and services.
- **Root & User Management**: Set up a secure root password, created and configured user accounts with appropriate permissions, and practiced using `sudo`, `usermod`, and `groups` to manage access and privileges.

## Key Takeaways
- A secure and well-organized system is the foundation for any serious DevOps work.
- Understanding the network stack and system structure makes troubleshooting and automation much easier.
- Disk encryption and proper user management are essential for both security and operational best practices.

## Reflection

Every day I spend digging deeper into Linux, I feel more confident and prepared for the challenges ahead. My VM is now not just functional, but robust, secure, and tailored for real-world DevOps scenarios. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll continue building on this foundation and start automating more of my setup!
