# ðŸ’» Day 3: Mastering Essential Shell Commands

Today, I dove deep into the world of shell commands, focusing on the most important and powerful tools every DevOps engineer should know. I spent hours practicing, experimenting, and refining my command-line skillsâ€”an absolute must for anyone serious about system administration and automation.

To help others (and my future self), I created a comprehensive documentation file in my DevOps Cloud Portfolio, listing the 60 most useful bash commands with descriptions and examples. Check it out here: [60 Greatest Bash Commands](https://github.com/Vlad-PLK/DevOps-Cloud-Portfolio/blob/main/docs/linux-terminal-commands.md)

Mastering Linux, the shell, and core system administration concepts is non-negotiable for a successful DevOps career. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m dedicating so much time this week to going deeper and building a rock-solid foundation.
