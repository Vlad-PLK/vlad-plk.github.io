Hi everyone! (Bonjour à toutes et à tous 🇫🇷🥖)

I'm **Vladimir Polojienko** (aka **Vlad-PLK** on GitHub), a 22-year-old freelance developer with a warm and friendly spirit, always eager to connect and share my journey.

After completing the core curriculum at the **42 Nice School** and validating my first internship in a blockchain startup, I found myself searching for a new challenge—a fresh step in my developer journey. For a while, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to become. I launched myself as a self-employed entrepreneur, exploring various business ventures and successfully building a solid, comfortable income. However, I realized I had drifted too far from my initial path: programming.

After some tough self-reflection, I decided to try a new path in my career and set my sights on becoming a DevOps engineer. I gave myself 3 to 4 months to truly master all the essential skills in the market and to make DevOps my main freelance activity.

This new challenge has totally reignited my passion for learning and growth! The thought of diving into so many new skills, soaking up fresh knowledge, and exploring a whole new world of programming has given me a fresh sense of purpose. This journey is all about pushing myself, proving to myself that everything I’ve learned at 42 and through my own experiences has really prepared me to jump into a new field—and come out even stronger for it.

If you’re here, you’re seeing not just my technical progress, but also my personal transformation. I hope my story inspires you to embrace new challenges and believe in your own ability to grow, adapt, and succeed.
