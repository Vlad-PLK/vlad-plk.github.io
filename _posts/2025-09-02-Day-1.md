Welcome to the very first entry of my DevOps & Cloud Blog! ðŸ‘‹

As a programmer trained at 42 Nice, I already have a strong background in Linux and the terminal. My first day was all about getting back into the SysAdmin mindset, revisiting essential shell skills, and laying the groundwork for my DevOps adventure.

Today, I focused on setting up my learning environment and mapping out the path ahead. I explored what it truly means to become a DevOps Engineer, the skills Iâ€™ll need to master, and the challenges Iâ€™m excited to tackle. This blog will serve as my daily log, where Iâ€™ll share progress, insights, and resources as I grow in the world of DevOps.

Let the journey begin!
