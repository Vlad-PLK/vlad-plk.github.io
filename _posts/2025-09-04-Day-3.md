title: "Day 3 : Linux fundamentals"
date: 2025-09-04 22:34:30 +0000

Today I've continued my way through bash terminal commands, linux concepts and system administration skills

I've created a beautiful doc file in my portfolio about some of the most usefull terminal commands with their relative description and exemple. Check it out here : [60 Greatest Bash Commands](https://github.com/Vlad-PLK/DevOps-Cloud-Portfolio/blob/main/docs/linux-terminal-commands.md)

I think that if i want to be a great DevOps it's almost impossible to don't know well linux, shell and the fundamental concepts of system administration. So that's why during this first week I was so deep inside learning more about it !
