# üñ•Ô∏è Day 4: Setting Up My Mac for DevOps Success

Today was all about laying a solid technical foundation for the months ahead. I dedicated my fourth day to preparing my Mac for the entire DevOps roadmap, ensuring that my development environment is robust, reliable, and ready for anything.

## System Setup & Essential Tools

I started by installing and verifying all the core tools and dependencies I‚Äôll need:
- **Homebrew**: The backbone of package management on macOS. Updated and installed all essential packages.
- **Docker Desktop**: Installed, configured, and ran test containers to confirm everything works smoothly.
- **VirtualBox**: Set up for running VMs and testing infrastructure scenarios.
- **Kubernetes (via Docker Desktop & kubectl)**: Ensured local clusters can be spun up for hands-on practice.
- **Git**: Checked configuration, SSH keys, and repository access.
- **Python, Node.js, and other dev tools**: Installed via Homebrew for scripting and automation.
- **VS Code & Extensions**: Set up my main editor with all the plugins I‚Äôll need for DevOps work.

## Verification & Troubleshooting

I double-checked that all dependencies were up-to-date and compatible. Ran test containers, spun up a local Kubernetes cluster, and verified VM creation in VirtualBox. Fixed minor issues with permissions and network settings to ensure a smooth workflow.

## Practicing Linux Commands

To keep my skills sharp, I revisited my curated list of essential Linux terminal commands and spent time practicing in the shell. This daily habit is already making me faster and more confident on the command line.

## Reflection

A well-prepared environment is key to productivity and learning. Taking the time to set up my Mac properly means I can focus on real DevOps challenges without being slowed down by technical hiccups. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll dive deeper into hands-on projects and start building out my portfolio!
