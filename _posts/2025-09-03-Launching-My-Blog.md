# Building the Foundation & Launching My Blog

**Focus Area**: Linux Fundamentals & Networking Basics

---

## üéØ Context & Objective

Setting up a GitHub Pages blog to document my DevOps journey and revisiting Linux fundamentals with a DevOps lens. Even though I have solid Linux experience from 42 School, I want to strengthen the DevOps-specific aspects that will be crucial moving forward.

## ‚úÖ Work Recap & Achievements

**Blog Infrastructure Complete**: Successfully set up this GitHub Pages blog using Jekyll. The entire process was a great refresher on Git workflows, static site generators, and automated deployment pipelines.

**Linux Foundation Review**: Spent quality time revisiting core Linux concepts with a DevOps lens, focusing on system administration tasks I'll need for container orchestration and cloud deployments.

**Development Environment Optimization**: Fine-tuned my workspace for the 12-week journey ahead, ensuring all tools and workflows are properly configured.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Fully functional GitHub Pages blog with custom Jekyll configuration
- Refreshed understanding of Linux file systems, permissions, and process management
- Documented Week 1 learning objectives and technical skill targets
- SSH key configuration verified and secured for GitHub integration

## üßó Challenges & Struggles

**Jekyll Learning Curve**: Had to brush up on Liquid templating and Jekyll's directory structure. The documentation is comprehensive but took some time to navigate effectively.

**Scope Management**: Caught myself wanting to perfect every detail of the blog setup instead of focusing on content creation. Had to remind myself that consistent progress beats perfect presentation.

## üìö Key Learnings & Progress

**Technical Skills Gained:**
- Jekyll static site generation and GitHub Pages deployment workflow
- Advanced Git branching strategies for documentation and code management
- Linux systemd service management and process monitoring techniques
- SSH tunneling and advanced key management for secure remote access

**DevOps Connections**: Started seeing how foundational Linux skills directly connect to container management, infrastructure automation, and cloud operations. The investment in solid fundamentals pays off throughout the entire learning journey.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps & Closing Thoughts

The blog setup took longer than anticipated, but it's a crucial tool for accountability and documentation. My Linux review reinforced how much I've retained from 42 School while highlighting areas where DevOps-specific knowledge builds on this foundation.

Next up: mastering shell commands with a focus on the most critical commands for DevOps workflows, creating a comprehensive reference document that will serve as a quick-access resource throughout my entire learning journey. üíª
